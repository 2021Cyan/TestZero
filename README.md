    2D Unity Game Development Journal
</h1>

#### The journal will explore the path and hardships we experienced throughout the development of a 2D shooter with Unity. We hope it will help whoever is interested in game development, especially with Unity, to learn from our experiences.

## GameObjects and Components

GameObjects are containers for Components. Components are the building blocks of GameObjects and define their behavior and appearance.

## Camera & UI

## Input Handling

Old Input System VS New Input System

Check usr input through Update() or through Events.

## Optimization

Reduce the use of Update(). Use events or coroutines where possible to reduce unnecessary processing.
